# Theremin #

Larumbe Theremin, based on OpenTheremin by Urs Gaudenz (http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/)


## Overview ##

Functionality is similar to OpenTheremin with extra features, such as autoplaying a midi song in calibration mode, LEDs to check whether notes are in correct pitch, input debouncing to filter spurious short pulses after frequency mixer...

Schematics/layouts will SOON be uploaded.

There are some filter tests on MATLAB folder.

Makefile makes use of Arduino-Makefile (https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) to compile/upload files to Arduino by using command-line/Emacs.
